# SFU-cmpt724-Affective-Computing
This repository is for archiving all homework for SFU-cmpt724 Affective Computing course

## Homework1 - Deep Dive Research Paper
+ Writing a research paper about one emotion with depth.

## Homework2 - Clustering and Visualization
+ Provided a mystery dataset of 500 faces with varied facial expressions.
+ Performed clustering and analyzed these static images, represented by features that can include gaze, facial action units, etc.
+ Completed dimensionality reduction, visualization, clustering, and interpretation.
+ Post-clustering Analysis

## Homework3 - Classification and Evaluation
+ Used the "FER2013" dataset, which contains over 30K static images with different kinds of facial expressions.
+ Used â€œPhoebe Buffay" reactions from the famous TV show F.r.i.e.n.d.s. to assess the performance of models on novel data.
+ SVM and CNN are used for classification.
+ Transfer learning was used to improve the performance of CNN trained on FER2013 on the Phebe Buffay dataset.

## Final Project - Expression Parkour Master
+ The detailed project is archived in this repo: https://github.com/apphiaWang/expr_parkour.
